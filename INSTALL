The following packages are required for building:

Debian/Ubuntu:
apt-get install autoconf build-essential python-cjson libxen-dev \
    python-anyjson python-pip python-crypto libtool python-dev
pip install pyxenstore

CentOS/RedHat, etc:

(Will update this later.  Use the packages above as a guide)


The following is needed for make install or make bintar:

patchelf  -- You can find a package for it here:
             http://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/patchelf/master
             Click the number to the left of the latest green build,
             then click the number to the left of the correct package


To build on Linux:

1) sh autogen.sh
2) ./configure
   (default prefix is /usr which means that the agent will be installed
   into /usr/share/nova-agent/<version>.  A symlink will be created in
   /usr/sbin for nova-agent)
3) make
4) make check
5) sudo make install (or sudo make bintar)
  a) If make install was used: /usr/bin/env bash scripts/installer.sh
  b) If make bintar was used: run installer.sh from the root of the archive after extraction
6) ln -s /usr/share/nova-agent/<VERSION>/etc/nova-agent.init /etc/init.d/nova-agent
7) update-rc.d to add to appropriate runlevels

To build on FreeBSD:

1) sh autogen.sh
2) ./configure
   (default prefix is /usr which means that the agent will be installed
   into /usr/share/nova-agent/<version>.  A symlink will be created in
   /usr/sbin for nova-agent)
3) gmake
4) gmake check
5) sudo gmake install (or sudo make bintar)
6) ln -s /usr/share/nova-agent/<VERSION>/etc/nova-agent.freebsd.init /etc/rc.d/nova-agent
